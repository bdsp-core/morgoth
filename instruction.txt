1. Set up the runtime environment

In Morgoth_20250401/

	conda create -n morgoth python=3.12 # conda create -n morgoth python=3.11

	conda activate morgoth

If you have GPU with cuda driver, run

	pip install -r requirements.txt # pip install -r requirements_cuda122.txt

	conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia

	# conda install pytorch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia

Else windows:

    pip install -r requirements_windows.txt


2. Run continuous prediction by continuous_event_level.sh

Run code: bash continuous_event_level.sh

See the comments at the beginning of the Bash file to understand the meaning of each parameter in the command.

p.s. The data in test_data folder was based on the Dropbox path and raw data.



3. Run discrete prediction by discrete_event_level.sh

Run code: bash discrete_event_level.sh

See the comments at the beginning of the Bash file to understand the meaning of each parameter in the command.
	
p.s. The data in test_data folder should be processed first.



4. Run EEG level prediction by EEG_level.sh

Run code: bash EEG_level.sh

See the comments at the beginning of the Bash file to understand the meaning of each parameter in the command.

p.s. The EEG_level inputs are the event-level output results with 1-second slipping step.


5. If linux and cpu

Run code: bash EEG_level_cpu.sh


6. If windows and cpu

Run code: EEG_level_windows_cpu.bat
